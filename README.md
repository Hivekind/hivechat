# HiveChat

## Project Description
HiveChat is a fully client-side chat application built with Next.js, allowing users to compare the output of different AI models (OpenAI and Gemini) side by side. Users can bring their own API keys to access the models, select different models for each chat box, and compare the responses concurrently.
